## Reproduce locally

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
cd yourrepository
```

Then, create a virtual environment and activate it (Python 3.8 or higher is recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

Next, install the required packages (listed in `requirements.txt`):

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, you can open any Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb` file) in preferred IDE and run all the cells (choose the kernel corresponding to your virtual environment).

Alternatively, you can start Jupyter Notebook server directly from the command line:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then you can open the notebooks in your web browser (use the link provided in the terminal).
